1. Introduction

These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Sim2Me website, eSIM products, digital services, and any related features (collectively, the "Services") provided by Sim2Me.

By using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and accepted these Terms. Your use of Sim2Me constitutes acceptance of these Terms. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you must stop using the Services immediately.

Sim2Me may update these Terms at any time. Your continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

2. Scope of Services

Sim2Me provides digital eSIM services, allowing you to purchase, activate, and use mobile data plans for international travel. Our Services include:

• Purchase of eSIM data plans for supported countries and regions
• Delivery of eSIM profiles (e.g. via QR code or activation link)
• Guidance for installation and activation
• Customer support for orders and connectivity

Sim2Me does not own or operate telecommunications networks. Connectivity is provided through third-party mobile operators. Network coverage, speed, and availability depend on those operators.

3. Eligibility

To use Sim2Me you confirm that:

• All information you provide (at signup, purchase, or support) is accurate and truthful
• You use the Services for lawful purposes only
• You are at least 18 years old or have legal capacity to enter into agreements in your jurisdiction

Use of Sim2Me for fraudulent, illegal, or abusive purposes is strictly prohibited.

4. Account and Security

If you create an account, you are responsible for keeping your login details confidential and for all activity under your account. You agree to notify Sim2Me promptly of any unauthorized use. Sim2Me is not liable for loss arising from compromised accounts or unauthorized access due to your negligence.

5. Device Compatibility

You must ensure that:

• Your device supports eSIM (eSIM-capable and compatible with our supported operators)
• Your device is network-unlocked
• Your operating system and hardware meet the requirements for eSIM installation and use

Sim2Me does not guarantee compatibility with every device, OS version, or manufacturer. Purchases made for incompatible devices are your responsibility and are non-refundable once the eSIM has been delivered or activated.

6. Purchase, Activation, and Installation

• You are responsible for following installation and activation instructions correctly. Incorrect installation, scanning errors, or failure to follow instructions are not grounds for refund.
• Data plans typically start when the device connects to the eligible network in the destination country (depending on plan terms).
• You need an active internet connection for initial eSIM installation.
• eSIM profiles (e.g. QR codes) are for single use and must not be shared or transferred. Once installed or activated, they cannot be reissued or refunded.
• Loss, deletion, or damage of an installed eSIM cannot be reversed, replaced, or refunded.

7. Service Availability

Mobile data performance depends on third-party telecom operators. Sim2Me cannot guarantee:

• Network stability or constant availability
• 5G or specific technology in all countries
• Uninterrupted connectivity or specific speeds
• Coverage in every area

Service quality may be affected by geography, weather, congestion, device limitations, or local regulations. Sim2Me is not responsible for network coverage or operator service quality.

8. Pricing and Payment

Prices for eSIMs and data plans are displayed on our website and may change without notice. You are responsible for verifying plan duration, data allowance, and coverage before purchase. Sim2Me is not responsible for roaming or other charges from your primary carrier.

9. Refund Policy

Refunds are subject to our Refund Policy. In summary: unused and uninstalled eSIMs may be refunded within 14 days of purchase. Once an eSIM is installed or activated, it cannot be refunded. For full conditions and how to request a refund, see our Refund Policy page and contact us at ${CONTACT} or via ${CONTACT_PAGE}.

10. Prohibited Use

You must not:

• Use the Services for fraud or to bypass telecom or legal restrictions
• Attempt to reverse-engineer, copy, or redistribute eSIM credentials
• Resell, share, or transfer eSIM profiles to others
• Interfere with or abuse our or our partners’ systems or networks

Violation may result in termination of access without refund and may be reported to authorities where applicable.

11. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, Sim2Me shall not be liable for:

• Errors caused by your installation, device, or misuse
• Unauthorized access to your account
• Service interruptions, delays, or failures caused by third-party operators or other external factors
• Loss of business, profits, or travel opportunities
• Any indirect, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages
• Incompatibility of your device or loss of data/connectivity

Sim2Me’s total liability for any claim shall not exceed the amount you paid for the specific eSIM plan in question.

12. No Warranty

Services are provided "as is" and "as available." Sim2Me does not warrant that networks will perform consistently, that eSIMs will work with every device, or that connectivity will be uninterrupted. You accept that travel connectivity varies by country and operator.

13. Suspension and Termination

Sim2Me may suspend or terminate your access without notice if you breach these Terms, if we suspect fraud or abuse, or if required by law or by a network provider. Terminated users are not entitled to refunds for any remaining service.

14. Privacy

Your use of the Services is also governed by our Privacy Policy. We collect and process personal data as described there. By using Sim2Me you consent to that processing.

15. Changes to Services

Sim2Me may modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Services (including plan availability, pricing, and supported countries) at any time, with or without notice.

16. Governing Law and Disputes

These Terms are governed by the laws applicable to Sim2Me’s place of business. Any disputes shall be resolved in the courts of that jurisdiction, unless otherwise required by mandatory law in your country.

17. Severability

If any part of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts remain in full force and effect.

Last updated: February 2025

We want you to be satisfied with your purchase. Our refund policy is designed to be fair while protecting against abuse. In general, eSIMs are digital products: once delivered or activated, they cannot be "returned." You may be eligible for a refund under the conditions below.

1. Unused and Uninstalled eSIMs (Within 14 Days)

If you have not installed or activated the eSIM on your device, you may request a full refund within 14 days of purchase. For example, if your travel plans changed and you no longer need the plan, contact us before activating the eSIM. We will process eligible refunds to the original payment method where possible.

2. Device Incompatibility

If after purchase you discover that your device is not eSIM-compatible or is carrier-locked (and you cannot use our service), you may be eligible for a full refund. We may ask for proof that the eSIM was never successfully activated or used. Contact us as soon as you discover the issue and within 14 days of purchase.

3. Technical or Service Issues

If you experience technical problems that originate from Sim2Me or our network partners (e.g. the eSIM does not provide data connectivity due to our systems or a covered network outage), contact our support and cooperate with troubleshooting. If we determine the issue is on our side and we cannot resolve it, we may issue a full or partial refund depending on usage.

4. Refund Request Procedure

• Contact us within 14 days of your purchase date (or within a reasonable time for technical issues).
• Include the email used for purchase, order confirmation or order ID, and a clear description of the reason for the refund.
• We may ask for additional information or steps (e.g. device settings, screenshots) before approving a refund.
• Refunds are issued to the original payment method when possible. Processing may take 5–10 business days depending on your bank or payment provider.

Reach us via ${CONTACT_PAGE} or ${CONTACT}.

5. When We Do Not Refund

We do not issue refunds in the following cases:

• The eSIM has already been installed or activated on a device
• You have used a significant portion of the data (except in cases of technical failure on our side)
• The request is made after 14 days from purchase (except where we agree otherwise for technical issues)
• Change of mind after activation, or selection of the wrong plan by the customer
• Issues outside our control (e.g. poor coverage in a specific location when our coverage information was accurate, or user configuration errors)
• Violation of our Terms of Service or misuse of the service
• Fees not paid to Sim2Me (e.g. bank or card fees, currency conversion fees)

6. Final Decisions

Sim2Me reserves the right to decline refund requests that do not meet this policy. All refund decisions are final. For questions, contact us at ${CONTACT} or via ${CONTACT_PAGE}.
