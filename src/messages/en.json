    "whatIsEsim": "What is an eSIM?",
    "answerWhatIsEsim": "An eSIM (embedded SIM) is a digital SIM built into your phone. It lets you activate a cellular data plan without needing a physical SIM card. Simply scan a QR code or tap a link to install — it's that easy.",
    "howToInstall": "How do I install my eSIM?",
    "answerHowToInstall": "After purchase, you'll receive an email with a QR code. On iPhone: go to Settings → Cellular → Add Cellular Plan → scan the QR code. On Android: go to Settings → Network & Internet → SIMs → Add eSIM → scan the QR code. Make sure you're connected to Wi-Fi during installation.",
    "whenToActivate": "When does my plan start?",
    "answerWhenToActivate": "Your plan activates when you connect to a mobile network at your destination. The validity period starts counting from first use, not from purchase. eSIMs are valid for 180 days before activation, so you can buy in advance.",
    "canUseDualSim": "Can I use my physical SIM and eSIM together?",
    "answerCanUseDualSim": "Yes! On dual-SIM devices, you can keep your physical SIM for calls and SMS while using the eSIM for mobile data. Go to Settings → Cellular and assign each SIM its role.",
    "dataRoaming": "Do I need to turn on Data Roaming?",
    "answerDataRoaming": "Yes — turn on Data Roaming for your eSIM line. This is required for the eSIM to connect to local networks. Make sure to turn OFF roaming on your physical SIM to avoid surprise charges from your home carrier.",
    "hotspot": "Can I use my eSIM as a hotspot?",
    "answerHotspot": "Most plans support personal hotspot / tethering. Check the plan details before purchase. On iOS, APNs are preconfigured automatically.",
    "multipleEsim": "Can I store multiple eSIMs on one phone?",
    "answerMultipleEsim": "Yes. iPhones can store up to 10 eSIM profiles, and Android devices can store 5–7. Only one eSIM can be active for data at a time. Label your eSIMs to keep them organized.",
    "topUp": "Can I top up my eSIM with more data?",
    "answerTopUp": "Some plans support top-ups. If available, you can purchase additional data for your existing eSIM — no need to install a new one. Check the plan details for top-up availability.",
    "reinstall": "Can I reinstall a deleted eSIM?",
    "answerReinstall": "Yes — if you accidentally delete your eSIM, you can reinstall it by scanning the original QR code, as long as the plan is still valid and has remaining data. However, an eSIM cannot be transferred to a different device once activated.",
    "refundPolicy": "What is your refund policy?",
    "answerRefundPolicy": "Unused and uninstalled eSIMs can be refunded within 14 days of purchase. Once an eSIM is installed or activated, it cannot be refunded. See our Refund Policy page for complete details.",
    "coverage": "How is network coverage?",
    "answerCoverage": "We partner with tier-1 local operators in each country for the best coverage. Coverage is excellent in urban areas. Rural coverage may vary by country. Check each plan's details for specific network information, including 4G/5G availability.",
    "compatibleDevices": "Is my phone compatible with eSIM?",
    "answerCompatibleDevices": "Most modern smartphones support eSIM — including iPhone XS and later, Samsung Galaxy S20+, Google Pixel 3+, and many more. Your device must be carrier-unlocked. Visit our Compatible Devices page for the full list.",
    "vpn": "Should I use a VPN with my eSIM?",
    "answerVpn": "While not required, a VPN can enhance your privacy when using public networks abroad. Make sure to turn off any VPN during eSIM installation, as it can interfere with the download process.",
    "noSignal": "What if I have no signal after arriving?",
    "answerNoSignal": "Restart your device to refresh the network connection. Make sure Data Roaming is ON for the eSIM line. If still no signal, try selecting a network manually: Settings → Cellular → Network Selection. It can take a few minutes to connect the first time."
