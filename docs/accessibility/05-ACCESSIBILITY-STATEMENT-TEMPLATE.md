## Accessibility Statement

**Last updated:** [DATE]

**[Site name]** is committed to ensuring digital accessibility for people with disabilities. We are continually improving the user experience for everyone and applying the relevant accessibility standards.

### Conformance target

We aim to conform to **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 at Level AA** ([W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag22/)), as well as to the functional accessibility requirements of **Directive (EU) 2019/882** (European Accessibility Act) where they apply, using **EN 301 549** as a technical reference (which currently references WCAG 2.1 Level AA for web content).

- **WCAG 2.2 Level AA** is our conformance target for this website.
- Conformance means that the content meets the Level A and Level AA Success Criteria of WCAG 2.2, except where noted under “Known issues and limitations” below.

### What we have done

We have implemented (or are implementing) accessibility across the site, including:

- Semantic structure (headings, landmarks, page title).
- Skip link to main content.
- Keyboard-accessible navigation and controls (visible focus, no keyboard traps).
- Color contrast that meets WCAG 2.2 Level AA where applicable.
- Text alternatives for meaningful images; decorative images hidden from assistive technology.
- Respect for `prefers-reduced-motion` where applicable.
- Forms with associated labels and clear error messages.
- Language and text direction (e.g. RTL for Hebrew and Arabic) set on the page.
- Accessible dialogs, menus, and other interactive components (focus management, ARIA where needed).

### Known issues and limitations

- **[List any known issues, e.g. “Some legacy PDFs may not yet be fully accessible.”]**
- **[Or: “We are still auditing third-party widgets (e.g. payment) for full WCAG 2.2 AA compliance.”]**
- **[Or: “None at this time.”]**

We are working to address these and will update this statement as we fix issues.

### Roadmap

- **[e.g. “Q2 2025: Complete audit of checkout flow and payment provider integration.”]**
- **[e.g. “Ongoing: Remediate issues found in automated and manual testing.”]**
